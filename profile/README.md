> Made in SouthTyrol

## Who are we?

We are Buonotti: two guys from SouthTyrol crafting software together.

Currently we are both studying at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).

Our main language is Go but we are not shy to try something new.

## What do we create?

Our project is called [Apisense](https://github.com/buonotti/apisense). Check out the repo to learn more about it!
